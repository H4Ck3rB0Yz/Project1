## About

 The new improved version of a dumb little raspberry pi. People sometimes tell me that the world is not good and nothing I do is going to work out. I will prevail though.

## Goals

 Have a working alarm clock which wakes me up tells me the time, weather, day, and bitcoin price. An added part to that and first part of that is having a display that shows me the time, weather, day, and bitcoin price. Though ambitious I shall do that.
